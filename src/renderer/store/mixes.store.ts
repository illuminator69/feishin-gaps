/**
 * navi-connect: "Mixed for You" — the hub's recipe collection, mirrored.
 *
 * **The gap this closes, stated precisely: a saved queue stores a *result*; a
 * mix stores a *recipe*.** Nothing in either client persisted
 * `{mode, seedId, moodCharacter, count}` before this — the auto-DJ runners take
 * them as arguments and drop them, the Mood Flow centroid is in-memory only, and
 * a saved queue exits into a frozen track list that replays rather than
 * regenerates. So "play that mix again" could only ever mean "play those exact
 * songs again", which is the one thing a mix is not.
 *
 * **The hub never generates anything.** It stores and broadcasts the recipe;
 * each client regenerates locally with the engine it already has. That keeps the
 * hub audio-free and AudioMuse-free, which is the standing rule for it.
 *
 * So this store is a **pure mirror**, like `hub.store`, and deliberately *not*
 * persisted the way `saved-queues.store` is. The asymmetry is worth naming
 * because the two look alike:
 *
 *   - A saved queue is captured automatically, on every client, constantly, so
 *     it needs a local cache, an offline accumulation path, a field-level union
 *     merge and tombstones.
 *   - A mix is created by hand, on one device, rarely. It is never published
 *     concurrently by two clients, so none of that machinery is needed — and
 *     leaving the asymmetry to be discovered later is how a second copy of the
 *     merge logic gets written for a problem that does not exist.
 *
 * No hub, no mixes. That is the honest state: the recipe lives there.
