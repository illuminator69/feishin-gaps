/**
 * "Fans also like" — and unlike every similar-artist surface this stack already
 * has, the artists you do *not* own are the point.
 *
 * Navidrome's own similar artists are library residents by construction, and
 * lb-bot's similar-albums shelf filters unowned candidates out on purpose
 * ("more of what you already have"). The merge behind both has always produced
 * unowned artists with real MusicBrainz ids and nothing has ever been able to
 * see them. `/lb/artist/similar` marks ownership instead of filtering, so this
 * row is the first surface in the app that can answer "who am I missing".
 *
 * Unowned rows route to the virtual `mb:<mbid>` artist page, which renders their
 * discography from lb-bot and is where a fill is started. Owned ones go to the
 * real page. `artistLinkPath` already encodes that choice and is shared with the
 * Fresh tile so the two cannot drift.
 *
 * An owned artist is drawn from Navidrome by id, so this row shows the same
 * photographs the artist carousels do. An unowned one has no id anywhere and
 * falls back to the empty-artist icon: an absent picture is an absence, not a
 * reason to drop to a text-only tile.
