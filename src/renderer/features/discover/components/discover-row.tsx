/**
 * The shell every Discover row renders inside.
 *
 * Two rules live here rather than in each row, because they are the two things
 * that went wrong everywhere else:
 *
 * 1. **A row with nothing to show renders nothing** — not a heading with an
 *    empty shelf under it, not a spinner that never resolves. Fresh, the
 *    similar-albums shelf and the CLAP entry each invented their own version of
 *    this and they do not agree. **A row that showed cards last time and is
 *    waiting for its answer is not "nothing to show", though:** it reserves its
 *    height with skeleton tiles, for a bounded time. Rendering nothing until the
 *    data arrived made every row below it jump down by a row's height, once per
 *    row, as each one answered. A row with no such history still renders
 *    nothing until it answers — a skeleton that then collapses is the same jump
 *    twice.
 * 2. **`because` is not optional.** The attribution rule this stack follows is
 *    that a recommendation names the thing that justifies it; an unattributed
 *    shelf is indistinguishable from a popularity chart. Making it a required
 *    prop is what stops a row shipping without one.
 *
 * The rows page through `GridCarousel`, the same component the home carousels
 * use, so they get this app's own arrows, its keyboard and wheel paging and its
 * card sizing rather than a hand-rolled scroller. It takes an opaque
 * `{content, id}[]`, which is why an lb-bot row can use it directly while the
 * typed wrappers (`album-infinite-carousel` and friends) cannot — those are
 * bound to Navidrome queries. Paging is local: these lists arrive whole and
 * already ranked, so there is no next page to fetch and the handlers are
 * deliberately empty, exactly as `AlbumArtistGridCarousel` does it.
