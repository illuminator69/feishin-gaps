/**
 * The two Deezer browse rows — "Charts" and "Editorial".
 *
 * One component, because they differ only in which feed they read and what
 * their reason line says. The rows themselves are identical in shape, and
 * writing them twice is how the two would come to disagree about, say, whether
 * an unresolved row is tappable.
 *
 * **These rows are honest about being a chart.** Every other Discover row names
 * something about *you* — an artist you listen to, a record you own, a mood you
 * asked for. These name popularity and an editor's taste, which is a weaker
 * claim, so they say so plainly rather than borrowing the grammar of a
 * recommendation. That is the whole reason `because` is a required prop.
 *
 * Deezer has no MusicBrainz ids, so lb-bot marks these feeds against its
 * **local** index by name and marks conservatively: a row it cannot place
 * carries no `rgid` at all. For a global chart that is most rows, because the
 * index only knows artists somebody has scanned — so treating them as inert
 * would make this row mostly decorative.
 *
 * Instead the id is fetched on **tap**: one MusicBrainz search for the one album
 * the user chose, rather than a per-row fan-out that would spend lb-bot's entire
 * 1 req/sec scanner budget on a shelf nobody touched. That split is lb-bot's own
 * design for these feeds. The acquire control is still withheld from an
 * unmarked row — one tap cannot be honest about a record whose identity is not
 * yet known, and the album page it opens is where the fetch belongs.
