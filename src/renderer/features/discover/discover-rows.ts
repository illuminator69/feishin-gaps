/**
 * navi-connect: the Discover row catalogue.
 *
 * **This table is duplicated in Navic, on purpose, and the ids are the
 * contract.** There is no shared build between the two repos and no codegen, so
 * "shared catalogue" can only ever mean "written twice and kept in sync". The
 * precedent is `MoodCharacter`, and it is a cautionary one: the same three
 * presets live in `auto-dj/audio-muse-source.ts` and in Navic's
 * `MoodCharacter.kt` with matching numbers but different ids and labels, and
 * they have already drifted — Feishin's auto-DJ escalates temperature per pass
 * and Navic's `topUp` does not. Writing the ids down in one place
 * (`navi-connect/CLAUDE.md` §6) is the only thing standing between this table
 * and the same fate.
 *
 * Every row declares the capability it needs, so the screen can answer "is
 * there anything to show" without each row inventing its own empty state. The
 * rule for lb-bot surfaces is stricter than for AudioMuse ones: not configured,
 * unreachable and unindexed all render **nothing**, and the page must look
 * exactly as it does without lb-bot at all.

 *
 * `mixes` leads deliberately: it is the only row showing something the user
 * made, and everything below it is a proposal from somewhere else. The two
 * Deezer rows sit *below* `similar-artists` for the matching reason — a chart
 * is the weakest claim on this screen and must not outrank a row that can name
 * why it is there.
 *
 * `stations` is deliberately absent rather than disabled. Persistent named
 * stations were the placeholder for what became `mixes`, and the word is spent
 * twice over: `Screen.RadioList` and Feishin's create/edit-station forms are
 * Subsonic internet radio, and `SavedQueueSource.RADIO` is the ephemeral
 * similarity mix. Hence "Mixed for You", and `mix` as the noun in code.
