/**
 * One answer for every Discover row, instead of six.
 *
 * Nothing here is a new mechanism — both probes already exist and are already
 * the right shape. `/lb/status` returns the list of routes the hub actually
 * serves, built for the permanent "my client is newer than its hub" condition;
 * `/sonic/clap/stats` always answers 200 with a `configured` flag so a caller
 * learns the feature is off rather than reading an error. What was missing is
 * that the two are unrelated systems — one react-query, one an imperative
 * `useState`/`useEffect` probe copy-pasted at each call site — so every surface
 * had to decide for itself what "absent" looks like, and they disagreed.
 *
 * The CLAP probe is wrapped in react-query here purely so both answers arrive
 * through the same door; it is the same underlying call.
