/**
 * "Not in your library" — MusicBrainz artists search reaches past the library.
 *
 * Before `/lb/artist/lookup` was whitelisted on the hub, a client could only
 * reach an external artist page if it already held an MBID from a Fresh row,
 * which blocked every acquisition path that starts with "I want this artist".
 *
 * Artists the library *does* have are not filtered out here, and deliberately
 * so: lb-bot answers with MusicBrainz's ranking and has no idea what Navidrome
 * holds, and hiding a row on a name match would hide the *right* artist whenever
 * two share a name. The section is placed last and labelled for what it is, so a
 * duplicate reads as "here is the MusicBrainz one" rather than as a mistake.
 *
 * Fail-soft like every other lb-bot surface: no hub, lb-bot down, or a query too
 * short to be worth a MusicBrainz second all render nothing.
