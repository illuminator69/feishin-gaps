/**
 * "Albums on MusicBrainz" — the album half of reaching past the library.
 *
 * The artist section next to this one is headed "Not in your library" and does
 * not filter, because lb-bot ranks by MusicBrainz and dropping a row on a *name*
 * match would hide the right artist whenever two share a name. This section is
 * headed differently on purpose: `/lb/album/lookup` marks ownership by
 * release-group id, which is exact, so an owned hit is a known fact rather than
 * a guess — and it is kept, badged, and opened as the library album.
 *
 * Keeping it (rather than filtering it out) is worth the row: Navidrome's own
 * search matches its own text, so an album the library holds under a different
 * spelling is missing from the library section above and this is the only place
 * it appears.
 *
 * Fail-soft like every other lb-bot surface: no hub, lb-bot down, or a query too
 * short to be worth a MusicBrainz second all render nothing.
