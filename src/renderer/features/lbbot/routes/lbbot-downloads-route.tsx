/**
 * navi-connect: everything lb-bot has been asked to fetch from Soulseek, in flight
 * and finished.
 *
 * A fill takes minutes — search, transfer, tagging, placement, then Navidrome's own
 * scan — and until now it was visible *only* from the artist page that started it.
 * Navigate away and there was no way to see it, no way to know it had failed, and no
 * way to ask again.
 *
 * Nothing here polls. The ledger watcher mounted at the app root reads every
 * unsettled row in one request whether or not this page is open — this view used
 * to watch only the rows that passed its filter, so choosing "Didn't land" stopped
 * the fills in flight from being polled at all. Every word and every button comes
 * from `describeFill` (PROTOCOL §15.2), the table Navic renders from too.
