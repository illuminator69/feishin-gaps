 * B-071: the number a gap row is listed under.

 * lb-bot's gap rows carry `disc` since S-022, and `position` restarts on every
 * disc, so a two-disc gap read 1, 2, 1, 2 with nothing to tell the rows apart.
 * The disc is shown only when the gap has a row past the first one: a single-disc
 * gap, and any gap from an lb-bot that sends no `disc` (decoded as 0, "not known"),
 * reads exactly as it did.
 *
 * Pure, so `gap-position.harness.ts` can run it. Navic implements the same two
 * functions by hand (no shared build): change the rule in both.
