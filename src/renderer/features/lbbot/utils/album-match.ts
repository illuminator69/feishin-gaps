/**
 * Deciding whether two records that *look* alike are the same album.
 *
 * This exists because of one measured failure. `/lb/album/lookup` passes
 * MusicBrainz's own **text score** straight through, and that score rewards a
 * release-group whose *title* contains both search words over one where the
 * artist match lives in a different field. Measured 2026-09-23 against the
 * deployed service, `q=Daft Punk Discovery`:
 *
 *     1  Pignickel   Daft Punk's Discovery but it's in the SM64 Soundfont
 *     2  verymilkee  Daft Punk's Discovery, but with the SM64 soundfont […]
 *     3  Daft Punk   Discovery
 *
 * So taking the first hit opened a parody's download page for an album the user
 * owned in full. A fielded query fixes the ranking (`q` reaches MusicBrainz
 * verbatim, so it costs nothing and asks a different question), but a text score
 * can still be wrong — which is why the answer is additionally **validated
 * against what was asked** rather than trusted for being first.
 *
 * Declining is a correct outcome here. Opening the wrong album reads as the
 * feature being broken; "couldn't match that" reads as a near miss, which is
 * what it is.
