/**
 * One gesture to fetch a release the library doesn't have — and the one place
 * that decides when one gesture is honest.
 *
 * The blind version of this existed once and was removed: it fetched the wrong
 * record for a self-titled album, where every candidate folder's name looks
 * plausible, and nothing before or after the fact said so. `useAcquireAlbum`
 * keeps that review and only skips the picker when there is nothing left to
 * decide; everything else lands here as a `review` outcome and opens the picker
 * the tap would otherwise have bypassed.
 *
 * The spinner is not decoration. `/lb/album/sources` is a live slskd fan-out
 * taking 30-90s, and until the download is actually posted the fill ledger has
 * nothing to show — so without this the tile looks inert for a minute and gets
 * tapped again.
