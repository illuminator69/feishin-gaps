/**
 * B-026 (Feishin half): what `useFillAnnouncements` should say about a row that
 * just settled, kept apart from the toast/notify wiring so the decision can be
 * tested with `node --test` (no runtime imports here — see the harness).
 *
 * The bug this closes: a settled `'failed'` outcome does not always mean lb-bot
 * failed to get anything. Two cases reach `'failed'` with the files already sitting
 * in lb-bot, waiting to be filed:
 *   - a gap whose placement stalled (`stalledPlacement`, PROTOCOL §15.2's
 *     needs_match row, rulings R10/R15/R17) — the tracks downloaded but a rename
 *     or move needs a human in lb-bot's own workspace;
 *   - an album fill lb-bot reports as `needs_match` (`outcomeFor` in
 *     `use-lbbot.ts` folds this into `'failed'` before it ever reaches here).
 * Both should read as "downloaded, needs sorting out" rather than "couldn't get
 * it" — the second sends the user looking for a retry that would only refetch
 * files already on disk.
 *
 * Final-review fix: this module also owns the "needs sorting out" toast's link
 * target now (`announcementLinkPathFor`), because getting it wrong here is the
 * same mistake as getting the wording wrong — `ActiveFill.groupId` looks exactly
 * like `ActiveGap.groupId` at the call site (same field name, same "a status poll
 * learned this" story) but is NOT a review-group id at `needs_match`: lb-bot
 * repoints it at an import-recovery record (`rec<N>`,
 * `listenbrainz_bot.py`'s `_album_fill_set`), and `#/gaps/rec17` is a page lb-bot
 * answers "Group not found" on. Only `ActiveGap.groupId` resolves `#/gaps/<id>`.
 *
 * Q-031 (Feishin half): lb-bot reports `picking` for two different buckets — the
 * picker holding candidates and waiting on the user ("your move"), and the
 * `needs_match` bucket, files already `downloaded` and waiting on a manual match
 * only lb-bot's own workspace can do. `gapAwaitingMatch` is the one predicate
 * that tells them apart, shared by `applyGapSummary`'s settle (`use-lbbot.ts`,
 * via `gapSettleOutcome`) and the gap modal's own "Open in lb-bot" prominence
 * (`gap-fill-modal.tsx`) — two copies of this test would drift the way the
 * ledger and the modal already had.
