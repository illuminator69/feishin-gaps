 * The fill ledger: every download this client has asked lb-bot for, in flight and

 *
 * A download outlives the sheet that started it by a long way — search, transfer,
 * placement and the Navidrome verify add up to minutes — so the watch cannot live
 * in the modal's own state. This is what keeps the artist page polling after the
 * sheet is closed, what puts a progress ring on the tile, and what tells the page
 * to re-read the discography once a fill lands.
 *
 * Persisted, because minutes is long enough to quit the app in. lb-bot's own
 * ledger is in memory, so a rehydrated fill may well find nothing on the other
 * end — but `unknown` is already the bounded-patience case in useLbBotFillStatus,
 * so that resolves itself in about ninety seconds instead of leaving the user
 * with an album that silently stopped being tracked.
 *
 * Settled rows used to be *deleted*, which made settling and never-having-happened
 * the same thing: a fill that failed while the modal was closed left no trace and
 * no way to ask why. They are now kept with their outcome for a week, which is
 * what the downloads view lists and what a retry re-issues from.
