 * missing songs; Fill gaps turns the same box into the ranked sources for them; a request turns it
 * into the steps; the finish folds it to a result row and then to nothing. A failure keeps it open,
 * saying why.
 *
 * Which of those it shows is one function of what is known (lb-bot's gap record, this device's
 * ledger row for the group, where the user has the box, a tap in flight), so the box cannot be in
 * two states at once and every precedence is a case in `gap-stage.harness.ts`, ported from Navic's
 * `GapStageTest`. A transfer in flight is the truth whatever else is set: it may have been started
 * on another client. Pure: Navic's copy is `GapStage.kt`, written by hand (no shared build).
