// (an album/playlist play, a radio/journey/mood-flow generator) announces it here right before it

//   1. it names the queue — stamped ONCE, at birth, and never rewritten by playback; and
//   2. it declares "this is a NEW listening session", which is the only thing that mints a new
//      history record. Editing the playing queue (reorder, remove, play-next, Auto DJ top-up,
//      shuffle) is not a new session — it updates the record in place. Matching on queue
//      membership instead used to fork a near-duplicate card on every single edit.
