 * whether the hub's engine can be used at all. Only the station client and the hub frames write
 * it; every surface (the queue chip, the autoplay popover, Settings) reads it, never the
 * settings, so what they say is what built the queue.
 *
 * Fed by:
 *  - this client: a radio it starts (armed, then bound when the new queue session begins), the
 *    answers to its own `start` / `next`, and any new queue session that is not a station's
 *    (which unbinds);
 *  - the hub: `session.stationId`, `welcome.station` and `station` frames (use-hub.tsx).
 *
 * `bound` and the last catalogue are persisted, so a relaunch still names the radio and can
 * restart an expired station from its seed; the hub's `welcome` then states the truth.
