// A chip is a choice about the queue that is playing, and it takes effect now: Off takes out
// what the station queued that has not played, a character replaces it with a batch in that
// character. On a hub with `stationEdits`, for the session's bound station, the HUB makes that
// edit (B-143) and the client only signals. Otherwise the client edits: never the playing
// track, and the next one only when under 20 s of the playing one is left (B-145); and never a
// reload: a local queue in place, a remote session through `remove` acts and one `enqueue`,
// never a `setQueue` (the playing device would reload it, a gap in the music).
