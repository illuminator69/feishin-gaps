// navi-connect (B-058): "did somebody ASK for this playback?", answered by the place the play came
// from rather than by the player store. Pure apart from the one mark, so the guard decisions can
// be tested without React (play-request.harness.ts).
//
// use-hub arms guards against a RUNAWAY - the engine playing although nothing asked it to: a
// load whose async play() lands after its own pause (setQueue forces PLAYING, the pause follows,
// the engine resolves after both), or a startup auto-resume (on mpv, the engine's own `resumed`
// event is echoed back as `renderer-player-play`, which sets the store PLAYING). Those guards
// were "audio is rolling within N ms of the load/adopt -> pause it", and a play the user pressed
// inside that window rolls too: the armed-seek re-check paused a play pressed ~0.2 s after a
// paused transfer (B-058). "The store went PLAYING" cannot tell the two apart - both runaways
// above set it too - so the plays that are asked for are marked where they are asked for.
//
// Marked sources: the user's transport (player-context, hotkeys, media session, the main
// process's play / play-pause commands except mpv's echo, Feishin's remote, a queue row) and the
// hub's own play directives (do:play, do:jump, do:load with play). A play requested AFTER a
// guard was armed is that guard's audio, so the guard stands down; one requested before it (the
// newer load or adopt overrode it) does not count. A pause asked for at the same places
// (player-context's pause/stop/toggle, the hotkeys, do:pause) withdraws it again.
//
// The same mark lets a play pressed inside an adopt's hub-driven window claim the session once
// that window lapses (adoptClaimDelay) - publishQueue cannot claim inside it.
