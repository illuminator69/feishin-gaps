//
// The hub re-sends the whole list on `welcome` and on every `devices` frame, including frames
// that only change a volume or the active flag, so only presence is compared. The first snapshot
// of a connection is a baseline: a reconnect lists every device, and none of them just arrived.
// A device that drops for a moment (a socket reconnecting) is not an arrival either: it must
// have been offline or missing for ARRIVAL_MIN_ABSENCE_MS. `lastSeen` is bumped by every inbound
// frame, so it says nothing about presence and is not read.
