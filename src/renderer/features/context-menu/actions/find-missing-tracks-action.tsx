 * "Find 3 missing tracks" for an album the library holds only part of.
 *
 * It lives in the context menu rather than on the tile on purpose: tapping an
 * incomplete album opens the album, because the gap is the exception and not the
 * headline. Navic shipped it the other way round first and it was wrong.
 *
 * Renders nothing at all unless lb-bot knows this exact album is incomplete —
 * same fail-soft contract as the rest of the surface, only stricter: not
 * configured, unreachable, unindexed and complete all look identical from here.
 *
 * R11 (B-223): it opens the album page with its gaps box unfolded to the missing tracks (the modal
 * it used to open is gone; the album page can be reached from anywhere an album menu opens).
