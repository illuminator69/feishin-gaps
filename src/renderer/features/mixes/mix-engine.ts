/**
 * Regenerating a mix from its recipe.
 *
 * **This is the whole point of the feature, and the one thing a snapshot would
 * also pass a casual test of.** Playing a mix twice must produce two different
 * tracklists — otherwise it is a saved queue with a nicer name. Every branch
 * below therefore re-asks its source rather than reading anything cached: the
 * random and alchemy sources are non-deterministic by nature, and the two
 * library-query branches shuffle a pool several times the size of the answer.
 *
 * Nothing here is a new engine. With the hub's station engine (I-040) the
 * radio-like kinds start a station, which never serves what it served before or
 * what was played in the last two weeks, so a second play differs by design. The
 * other kinds, and every kind without the engine, route into machinery this
 * client already runs for Auto DJ.
