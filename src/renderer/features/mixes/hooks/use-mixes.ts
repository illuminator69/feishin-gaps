/**

 * locally before the hub has ever heard of it (it is captured automatically,
 * including offline), so a hub-only rename would silently drop the edit. A mix
 * is born on the hub — `saveMix` without an id is what mints it — so there is
 * nothing to apply locally, and the broadcast that comes back is the update.
 *
 * `sendHubAct` answers false when there is no connection, which is the whole
 * error handling this needs: there is nowhere else for the recipe to live.

/**
 * Running a mix, in two halves.
 *
 * **A mix has no fixed contents - that is the whole feature - so "what is in
 * this" had no answer until the engine had been run, and the only way to run it
 * was to tap the mix, which replaces whatever is playing.** That is a lot of
 * commitment for something whose contents cannot be seen, so `generate` is
 * split out: it runs the recipe and hands back the tracks without touching
 * playback, and `playGenerated` plays a list a preview already built.
 *
 * `playGenerated` deliberately does **not** regenerate. A second run would
 * produce a different tracklist and make the preview a lie about what it was
 * previewing.
 *
 * `generate` deliberately does **not** `touchMix` either: previewing is not
 * playing, and `lastPlayedAt` is a record of what was listened to.
 *
 * The order in `play` matters for the same kind of reason. `touchMix` fires only
 * after a regeneration produced something - a mix whose source has gone cold (an
 * unbuilt AudioMuse index, a deleted seed) must not climb the list for having
 * failed.
 *
 * A new listening session is announced, so the saved-queue history gets its own
 * card. The kind is `radio` rather than a new `mix` value: `SavedQueueKind` is
 * shared with Navic, whose own enum would not recognise a new member, and
 * `radio` already means exactly this - a generated, non-library session.
