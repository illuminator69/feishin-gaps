/**
 * The rediscovery set: four server-side smart playlists that surface music
 * already in the library and rarely or never played.
 *
 * Nothing in this stack does that today — there is no never-played shelf, no
 * deep cuts, no stale favourites, and every "discovery" surface points outward
 * at records you do not own.
 *
 * **Server-side on purpose.** These are Navidrome native smart playlists
 * (`POST /api/playlist` with `rules` criteria), so Navidrome keeps them current
 * by itself and *every* Subsonic client sees them — this one, Navic, and
 * anything else pointed at the same server. No polling, no client-side
 * computation, no second source of truth.
 *
 * Opt-in and created once. Minting playlists in someone's library on first
 * launch would be a surprising thing for a music player to do, and creation is
 * keyed on the name, so running it twice is a no-op rather than a duplicate.
 *
 * The rule JSON is Navidrome's own criteria grammar, written literally rather
 * than through the query builder: these are fixed definitions, and going via
 * `convertQueryGroupToNDQuery` would mean expressing them as query-builder
 * state first — a translation in the wrong direction.
