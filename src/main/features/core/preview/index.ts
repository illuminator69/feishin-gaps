/**
 * navi-connect preview client (main process).
 *
 * Two calls and nothing else: "is there a preview of this track" and "can a
 * preview be cast". Both are ordinary buffered JSON through the hub's
 * `/preview/*` proxy.
 *
 * **This module never touches audio.** The `streamUrl` in a resolve answer is
 * absolute, signed by the hub, and fetched by the renderer's `<audio>` element
 * (or by a Chromecast) directly from the sidecar. That is the whole point of
 * putting the media origin outside the hub — see `preview-types.ts`.
 *
 * Deliberately separate from the lb-bot client next door even though the two
 * share the hub transport: they are different upstream services with different
 * failure modes, and lb-bot's `describeFailure` sentences ("lb-bot is busy…")
 * would be actively wrong here.
 *
 * Fail-soft throughout: no hub, no `PREVIEW_URL`, an unreachable sidecar and a
 * track with no match all resolve to the same "there is no preview", and the
 * surface hides its button rather than showing an error.
