 *   404 means *the hub proxies no such route* — it is older than this app and

 *   nothing until it restarts, which alone accounted for a whole round of "the
 *   button does nothing" on the Navic side.
 * - **502 is usually "busy", not "refused".** Every lb-bot route takes its
 *   process-wide `_review_lock`, and the hub's default 20s proxy timeout is the
 *   only thing separating slow from failed. The hub's own body reads
 *   `{"error": "lb-bot unreachable"}`, which taken literally is misleading while
 *   a large search holds that lock.
 *
 * Anything else prefers lb-bot's own `error`, which it writes for humans - except P1's two
