 * lb-bot's downloads mode and index progress, as the hub relays them (Worbus P1).
 *
 * Pure and import-free (tested by `lbbot-mode.harness.ts`). The rules are Navic's (lane N
 * ruling 3), adopted for Feishin:
 *
 * - `welcome.lb.downloads` is `"on"` or `"off"`; absent means an older hub or lb-bot, read as
 *   `unknown`, which behaves exactly as today (downloads shown, no P1-only offers).
 * - Every `welcome` restates the mode. An `lb` frame or a `/lb/status` read without the key
 *   keeps the current one, so an "off" a 409 taught holds until the hub says otherwise.
 * - A 409 `downloads_off` from any route sets off.
 * - The last known `on`/`off` per hub URL is remembered (at most four hubs; unknown never) and
 *   is the cold start's mode until the first welcome.
