# Results: F5, the motion kit and Home

Plan: `PLAN-feishin-home-and-motion-2026-10-21.md` with its addendum `01-ADDENDUM-baseline-and-cloud.md` and the per-task addenda (kept outside the
repo, in the F5 context package). Branch `redesign/home-and-motion`, cut from `origin/feat/redesign` at `22d169f` (the F4 merge, PR #7; it contains
F1's `ae8e15f3`, F2's `c58c0b50` and F3's `6f048a23`). Written 2026-10-21 at the end of the branch.

One session ran the plan inline (`executing-plans`), Tasks 1 to 9 in order, one commit per task, plus one fix commit from the Task 9 sweep
(`b0c773c`). One fresh whole-branch review follows; its findings, the fixes, the rulings and the deferred minors are appended at the end.

## Gates

| Check | Baseline (`22d169f`) | Final |
|---|---|---|
| `tsc -p tsconfig.web.json` (TS6307 filtered) | clean | clean |
| `tsc -p tsconfig.node.json` | clean | clean |
| eslint `--max-warnings=0`, every changed TS/TSX file (50) | - | clean |
| stylelint `--max-warnings=0`, every changed CSS file (13) | - | clean |
| `pnpm build:web` / `pnpm build:remote` | - | exit 0 / exit 0 (after Tasks 2, 3 and 9) |
| The 47 existing harnesses | 783 pass, 0 fail | 783 pass, 0 fail (`tint-hues` gained a case, counted below) |
| `arrival.harness.ts` (new, Task 1) | - | 5 pass |
| `nav-direction.harness.ts` (new, Task 1) | - | 3 pass |
| `tint-hues.harness.ts` (new, Task 1; one case added in Task 3) | - | 5 pass |
| `home-items-migration.harness.ts` (new, Task 5) | - | 8 pass |
| `mood-parse.harness.ts` (new, Task 7) | - | 8 pass |
| `mood-mix.harness.ts` (new, Task 7; the stripe check widened in Task 8) | - | 12 pass |

53 harness files, 824 pass, 0 fail, run by hand (`node --test --test-reporter=tap <file>`, Node 22.22); CI does not run them. Every new harness was
seen to fail first with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` before its module existed. `tileColors` prints its worst case: 4.50:1 (hue 220 to 90, the light end
at h220 s58 l43).

**Install.** Not re-run: `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `pnpm-workspace.yaml` are unchanged since F3, whose override install (with `node-mpv`)
is in place. Every pnpm command ran with `--config.verify-deps-before-run=false`, and the app was started with `./node_modules/.bin/electron-vite dev`.

## Watched running

`electron-vite dev` under Xvfb (2600 x 1500 screen, an 885 x 900 window), driven over CDP with the package's `cdp.mjs`, `motion-frames.js`,
`measure-home.js` and `measure-layout.js`, against the package's stand-in (`--albums 60 --songs 2000 --playlists 12 --missing 0.3 --hub-port 4790`,
its mood routes copied from the hub's code). States were set through the stand-in's `/__mode` switches, `store_settings` seeds before launch, and
the stores via the dev handle (`window.__f2`, extended in Task 5 with `queryClient` and `useMixesStore`). Frames are software rendering: they are
quoted for shape and order, never as the owner's speed; Home's mount blocks the main thread for 400 ms or more here, so early frames are sparse.

### The kit (Tasks 1 and 2)

| What | Seen |
|---|---|
| Page push (a Link to Home) | `main[data-nav=forward]`: 0 ms opacity 0.00 x 18, 83 ms 0.80 / 3.7, 567 ms 1.00 / 0 (final code); Task 2's run: 233 ms 1.00 / 0; `getAnimations()` page-push 220 ms |
| Page pop (`history.back`) | `data-nav=back`: 0 ms 0.00 / -18, 133 ms 0.80 / -3.7, done by 700 ms; at the final code the frames resumed at 400 ms (mount) and read 0.80 / -3.7 at 483 ms |
| A hash change with no router index (Settings by `location.hash`) | `data-nav=none`: the fade only, page-fade 220 ms |
| Sidebar minimise / expand (grid track) | 240 -> 196.7 -> 150.5 -> 110.9 -> 88 px over about 300 ms; expand 88 -> 108.6 -> 155.1 -> 195.4 -> 228.1 -> 240 |
| Queue close / open (third track) | 368 -> 325 -> 145 -> 77 -> 52 (the rail); open 52 -> 363 -> 368 |
| Reduced motion (`--media reduced`) | push and pop opacity 1, translate 0 in the first matching frame; every grid toggle one value; sidebar crossfade (a launch with the emulation on): opacity 1.00 throughout, against a normal launch's 1.00+0.00 ... 0.54+0.46 ... 0.00+1.00 |
| Old profile, `general.expressiveMotion: true`, version 37 | loads to Home, no `data-motion` attribute; one console error, `<motion.div> is unrecognized`, from `sidebar-playlist-list.tsx:797` (`component="motion.div"`), present at the base and not touched here |
| F3's shell (`measure-layout.js`) | queue open and closed at 800 x 600: identical to the base CSS hot-swapped in; at 800, 1100, 1280, 2560 in every Home state: gaps 8 / 8 / 8 / 8 / 8, no document scroll, no horizontal overflow |

### Covers (Task 3), covers held 800 ms by the stand-in

| What | Seen |
|---|---|
| A cell scrolled into view | the tint 1.00 from 0 ms; Task 3's run: the image at 1050 ms, opacity 0.00, 0.21, 0.59, 0.79 ... 1.00 at 1317 ms (about 267 ms), the tint fading out in step; at the final code 0.59 at 900, 0.94 at 1000, 1.00 at 1100 ms |
| The same cover a second time (Albums again) | the image at opacity 1.00 in its first frame (the stand-in sends no `Cache-Control`, so the tint holds while it is fetched again) |
| A recycled cell (3000 px away and back) | a new element, opacity 1.00 in its first frame |
| The player bar's cover changing (mediaNext twice) | tint 0.00 throughout; the old image decoded at 1.00 until the new one lands, both mounted while the new one fades 0 -> 1, the old one unmounted about 50 ms after |
| Reduced motion | the image at 1.00 in one frame, the tint gone in the same frame |
| Side queue rows (48 x 48) | the placeholder's radius 5 px = the image's |
| Neighbouring ids | al-15 and al-16 got hues 352 and 349, so checked: 3 of 59 adjacent pairs within 10 degrees (55 of 1000 over al-1 to al-1001), the rate random hues give; kept |

### Tiles (Task 4)

| What | Seen |
|---|---|
| Home arriving, a shelf of 8 (2200 x 1100, time = the arrival clock) | delays 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 150, 150 ms; at 150 ms tiles 1, 2, 5, 6: 0.97/0.3, 0.93/0.6, 0.44/4.5, 0.00/8.0; at 317 ms 1.00, 1.00, 0.99, 0.98/0.2; all 1.00/0 by 390 ms. Order and shape as `spec/home-board.md`'s table |
| The replay guard (`watch` / `late(900)`) | 0 late after: paging every shelf twice, `queryClient.invalidateQueries()` of everything, scrolling Home 400 px at a time, scrolling the Albums grid 30 steps and the side queue's table; the stand-in has no 5,000-row table (its song list is empty) |
| Skeletons | a cold load with `/api/album` held 2.5 s and 3 s: the skeleton grids carry no `data-arrive`; each real shelf arrives when it lands (13.2 s and 13.9 s into the load, its first tile's rise at t=0) |
| Scratch proof (reverted) | `useArrival` on the virtualised Albums grid's cells: 30 steps of 400 px to the end and back added 0 new `[data-arrive]` |
| Reduced | no `[data-arrive]`, no animation, opacity 1 |

### Home (Tasks 5 and 6)

| What | Seen |
|---|---|
| Title | "Home", Bricolage Grotesque 30 px, top 130, above the first block |
| Old default profile (version 37, feature on + single, recentlyReleased off) | version 38; recentlyAdded, fresh, mixes, rediscovery, recentlyPlayed, mostPlayed, random, recentlyReleased (off), similarArtists, playlists, genres; the feature carousel off |
| Customised `[mostPlayed, recentlyAdded (off), genres]`, feature on + multiple | those three in that order, then fresh, mixes, rediscovery, similarArtists; the feature carousel stays on |
| Settings import of an export written at version 37 | lands migrated: the new order, the feature off |
| Settings > Home page configuration | the eleven rows with the new labels; Home follows the stored order |
| No lb-bot, and lb-bot with nothing fresh | Fresh, Your mixes, Rediscover and Artists you might like take no height and no gap (recentlyAdded -> recentlyPlayed 32 px, one gap); no heading |
| Fresh with seeded lb-bot data | Owned / Not owned at left 8, top 8, 11 px 700, padding 2 px 7 px, radius 5 |
| A seeded mix | "Your mixes" with one tile; none -> gone |
| Continue listening | 60 px cards; columns by the page's width: page 176 or 492 -> 1, 656 or 792 -> 2, 972, 1936, 2252 -> 3; the live queue first; nothing sticking out; with 12 queues 2 or 3 displayed and Tab skips the rest; the ellipsis and a right-click give Resume, Preview queue, Save as playlist, Remove from history; a click and Enter resume through the app's own "Discard the current queue?" |

### Moods (Tasks 7 and 8)

| What | Seen |
|---|---|
| The main client (`window.api.mood`) | ok: 13 moods, 10 home with 4 tiles; relax/acoustic 300 ids; unknown mood or variant: unknown 404; `absent`: absent; `down`: unavailable 503; `list-503`: list unavailable; `analysis-off`: catalogue with `available` false; hub switched off: unavailable 0. The stand-in saw `Bearer tok` |
| A draw (relax/acoustic) | missing 0: ready 50 in 64 lookups; 0.7: ready 50 in 192 (125 not found); 0.95: short 14 in 288; 1: empty in 288; list 503: unavailable, 0 lookups; aborted: AbortError; no artist twice within 4; longest 477 s under the 480 s limit |
| Chips | ten, in the hub's order, 30 px; the row scrolls sideways at page widths 492 and 792, not at 972 and wider; absent when mood search is absent, the hub is off or the server is not Navidrome (Continue at 197 with no chips, 251 with) |
| First frame of a launch | with a stored catalogue the chips are first seen in the same MutationObserver callback as the title; `down`: still there; `absent`: shown from the copy, then removed and the copy cleared; with no copy they came 403 ms after the title |
| The fold (select, then clear) | mood 0 -> 80 -> 527 -> 585 -> 591 px by about 450 ms; shelves 2483 -> 2262 -> 651 -> 173 -> 10 -> 0 by 600 ms; clear the reverse; the chips' top 193 throughout; reduced: one value from the first frame |
| Shelves across a mood | a carousel paged to page 2 and the page scrolled 300 px: both kept after select and clear |
| Tiles | relax/acoustic, relax/mellow-beats, relax/piano-jazz, relax/indie, arriving; each mood's tiles arrive once when it opens (after `b0c773c`, also when switching straight from one mood to another) |
| The preview | building (8 skeleton rows) then ready at 2.5 s with `list-slow`; "Relax mix, 50 songs, 4 h 24 min, from your library"; Play these queues the same 50 names in the same order; the saved queue is radio-kind with the tile's title as `sourceName`, and shows under "Saved from these mixes"; short, empty and unavailable read as the contract says, each with Retry |
| The tile's play button tapped twice | `aria-busy` at the second tap; one `POST /sonic/mood/list`; one queue |
| Saved from these mixes | radio-kind records named after a tile kept; a renamed one and a playlist called "Soul" dropped |
| The catalogue failing while a mood is selected | `down`: the chip stays, the body says mood search is not available, Retry restores the tiles; `absent`: the chips, the selection and the body go and the shelves open (54 px less at the top) |
| Keyboard | chips are a group of buttons; Enter selects; "Clear mood" first while selected; then tile, its play button, the next tile; 2 px rings; Escape from the preview returns focus to the tile |

### Contrast on rendered pixels (Task 9)

Hues 40, 120, 250, dark and light, over `fixture:black`, `fixture:grey25`, `fixture:split` and a generated cover (`al-17`), and with `Cover colours`
off; background from a screenshot pixel inside the element away from glyphs, text colour through a canvas.

Two full runs: the first before the badge fix, the second after it (`frames/t9-contrast.txt` in the session's scratchpad holds the second). The
lowest of each, Cover colours on (all 24 configurations) and off:

| Text | Run 1, wash | Run 2, wash | Off |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chip (not selected) | 5.47 (al-17, h120 dark) | 6.59 (grey25, h250 dark) | 14.96 |
| Chip (selected) | 6.17 | 6.17 (black, h120 dark) | 5.00 |
| Continue title / line / glyph | 11.13 / 6.94 / 6.94 | 11.45 / 6.94 / 6.94 (light mode) | 14.96 / 6.61 / 6.61 |
| Owned / Not owned | 5.20 / **4.00** (black, h120 dark) | 6.17 / 15.87 (one transient row excluded, below) | 5.00 / 14.44 |
| Preview header | 8.52 (split, h120 light) | 8.52 | 6.61 |
| Mood tile title / second line (rendered, one run) | 5.44 / 4.62 at hue 40 | | the tile art is fixed; the harness proves every hue |

The chip numbers move between runs at the same configuration (the cause is not established; the chip is translucent); every reading is above 4.5.

**Finding, fixed in `b0c773c`:** Not owned measured 4.0:1 on a bright cover at hue 120 dark: its chip was 73% opaque (the wash bar is itself 94%
opaque and was mixed at 78%). At 90% it reads 15.87 or more. One later row (split, h250 light) read Owned 2.44 and Not owned 4.15; the same
configuration measured twice more read 8.09 and 15.99, so it was a transient (most likely the re-seeded Fresh row still rising when the shot was
taken).

## Reasoned from code only (NOT VERIFIED)

- **The real hub's mood routes**: their timing, the real lists and the final tile titles (the stand-in's catalogue is copied from the hub's code).
- **A real lb-bot**: Fresh and its badge were seeded through the query cache and the hub store; Artists you might like with data, Rediscover with a
  rediscovery playlist set; Discover's own skeleton row (`/explore` renders nothing against the stand-in).
- **The album detail page's push**: the stand-in serves no `GET /api/album/<id>`; the album list page stands in (the same `AnimatedPage`).
- **The command palette's group fold under reduced motion**: same `useReducedMotion` pattern as the sidebar, not opened.
- **A hash preview** (blurhash, thumbhash): Navidrome sends none; with a `hashUrl` the tint is not drawn and the preview shows as before.
- **The glassy-dark theme** on the tint (it carries `.hash`, so the 18 px radius applies) and on the Continue card's cover (the glassy image override
  is more specific and will round it).
- **A non-Navidrome server**: only the server type was switched in the store.
- **The OS reduced-motion setting** on Windows, macOS and the owner's Linux desktop (emulated here with `--media reduced`); a real GPU; the owner's
  library, saved queues and mixes; `prefers-color-scheme` changing while the app runs.
- **`MixPreview` on the mixes route** plays, then closes all modals, which would also close the app's "Discard the current queue?" confirm that
  playing opens; the mood preview had exactly that and now closes first. Not this plan's code, not tried there.

## Calls made beyond the plan

- **`homeItems` is taken whole by the persist merge** (`store/utils.ts`), like `columns`: lodash merges arrays index by index, so a stored list
  shorter than the new 11-row default came back with the default's tail appended (duplicates). Seen and fixed in Task 5.
- **`tileColors` checks both stripe hues on both ends**: the tile paints one stripe in its second hue over both ends (the board's CSS); the plan's
  harness text blends each end with the other's hue. Checking both covers both readings (Task 8).
- **The preview's Play these closes the modal before playing** (above).
- **`useArrival`'s `propsFor` is stable** (a `useCallback`), so the carousel and the cards can memoise on it (Task 4).
- **`Fold` takes a `name`** for its `data-fold` hook (Task 1).

## Open for the owner

1. **The chips on your hub**: they appear once F5 is merged and Feishin points at the NAS's dev hub, which has the routes. The 40 tile titles are
   the hub's and not final until the tiles' ear sheet is rated. Look at them there.
2. **The featured carousel**: switched off by the migration for profiles on the default pair (on, single); the Settings switch is still there.
3. **Expressive motion is gone**: no in-app switch, only the OS setting; the shell's tween is on for everyone; the Material overlays are not offered.
   Whether the OS setting reaches Electron on your Linux desktop is not verified.
4. **The song-relative queue chips** and mood as a station's source or the radio's filter: the hub side is built; each needs a Feishin task.
5. **The board's genre line on a mood tile** (the tile says "About 50 songs") and its right-aligned "because" lines on the shelves.
6. **Not built**: hover easing (120 ms), the tab motion (F6), "a box follows its content's height" (F7).
7. **Titles**: "Your mixes" against the board's "Your mix"; "Artists you might like".
8. **A mood tile opens a preview modal and its button plays**; Navic opens a page. Whether Feishin wants a page is yours to decide.
9. **The placeholder's tint comes from the image's id** (the item's name is not available to `ItemImage`).
10. **The mood tiles are darker than the board for hues about 25 to 205**: the board's own gradient gives white text 2.3 to 2.8:1 there; the
    harness forces 4.5, so the light end went below lightness 35 for hues 25 to 205 (and the dark end below 24 only at hue 90).
11. **Spacing at the top of Home**: the section heading's reason line sits under the title here (at the right on the board), Recently added's "See
    all", and the gaps between the title, the chips and the first block (a Stack gap and 24 px here, 8 px on the board).
12. Everything under NOT VERIFIED above.

## Try this

- Launch twice (the second launch has the stored catalogue): the chips are there with the title, nothing jumps.
- 1280 x 800, Home: click Relax; the shelves fold away and four tiles rise; click Relax again (or the x): the shelves come back where they were.
- Click a tile: the preview builds, then Play these; the queue is the rows you saw. Then look for the tile under "Saved from these mixes".
- Albums, then the back button: the page slides in from the left; a link slides it in from the right.
- Albums at any width, scroll fast: new covers fade in over a tint; ones you have seen show at once.
- Minimise the sidebar and open or close the queue: they tween now. With the OS's reduce-motion setting on, nothing moves.
